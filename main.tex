\section{Introduction}

\section{The realizability model}

We give a detailed construction of the realizability model: the logic used, the lambda-calculus and the realizability relation. We also give the standard theorem for a realizability model, namely the adequacy, which guaranties that we construct a consistant theory.

\section{The main result}

With our model constructed, and the proof that it describes a consistent theory done, we can describe the proof that this model satisfies $\FT$. We also show that $\WKL$ fails with a standard argument using Kleene tree.

\section{Generalization}

The realizability model from before uses the same ideas as developped in \cite{LubRat13} to prove $\FT$. For the argument in this proof to work, the two main conditions the emerge are
\begin{itemize}
\item continuity for the realizers
\item having a Kripke-style notion of future worlds in which, given a tree $T$ at some world $\enviro$, there exists a future $\enviroT$ in which a path in $T$ can be computed.
\end{itemize}
Hence, we seek for a general way to state these conditions (and a few other which will come later) in an abstract framework. The framework we use is the evidenced frames introduced in \cite{DBLP:conf/lics/0001MT21}. These evidenced frames (which we will shorten as EF) are combinatorial structures encompassing the notion of a realizability model: an EF contains a set of witnesses describing the realizers, a set of formulas describing the set of truth values and a relation akin to the logical inequality $\infSAT$, where the witness is made explicit.

A few work already study EFs \cite{DBLP:conf/lics/0001MT21,GarMiq23,DBLP:conf/lics/CohenGKM25}. In these works, the employed procedure is to consider concrete structure implementing realizability (\textit{e.g.} an abstract notion of computation system) and to prove that this structure is also an EF. In contrast, our work will focus only on EFs: the concrete structure will be introduced as a structure over EFs.

This section ends with the statement of the theorem \ref{thm:main}, which is a more abstract version of the theorem \ref{thm:FT}: in this version, the realizability structure realizing $\FT$ can have realizers of any form ($\lambda$-terms, Turing machines\ldots) as long as it gives an implementation of integers with its recursor, satisfies the two conditions mentioned above for the argument to work, and satisfies two technical conditions.
