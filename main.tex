\section{The realizability model}

We give a detailed construction of the realizability model: the logic used, the lambda-calculus and the realizability relation. We also give the standard theorem for a realizability model, namely the adequacy, which guaranties that we construct a consistant theory.

\section{The main result}
\label{s:realizability}

With our model constructed, and the proof that it describes a consistent theory done, we can describe the proof that this model satisfies $\FT$. We also show that $\WKL$ fails with a standard argument using Kleene tree.

\section{A robust interpretation of the Fan Theorem}

The realizability model developed in \Cref{s:realizability} relies on the ideas
of Lubarsky and Rathjen's work \cite{LubRat13} to prove $\FT$.
For the argument in this proof to work, the two main conditions that emerge are
\begin{itemize}
\item a notion of continuity for the realizers \emnote{of quantified relativization/individuals realized by a code}
\item having a Kripke-style notion of future worlds in which, given a tree $T$ at some world $\enviro$,
there exists a future $\enviroT$ in which a path in $T$ can be computed.
\end{itemize}
We shall now show the robustness of this approach: we shall highlight that the interpretation
is actually independent of the particular choice of a computational system as long as these conditions are satisfied.
To that end, we will use the notion of \emph{evidenced frames} introduced in \cite{CohMiqTat21}.
Evidenced frames (which we will shorten as EF) are combinatorial structures encompassing
the notion of a realizability model:
an EF contains a set of witnesses describing the realizers,
a set of formulas describing the set of truth values and
a relation akin to the logical inequality $\infSAT$, where the witness is made explicit.
In particular, it has the advantage of allowing one to abstract away
from the implementation details to show that any computational system satisfying
some specifications (\emph{e.g.}, memoization features) will induce a realizability model
satisfying the expected logical principles (\emph{e.g.}, countable choice~\cite{CohMiqTat21}).
In this section, we therefore seek for a general way to state the two conditions aboves
(as well as a few others which will arise later) using EFs.

In contrast with previous works using EFs~\cite{CohMiqTat21,GarMiq23,CohGruKirMiq25EffHOL,
CohGruKirMiq25mca}, where concrete structures used to define realizability interpretations
(\textit{e.g.} monadic combinatorial algebras) are proven to induce an EF,
here we will rather will focus only on EFs:
the concrete structure we study will be introduced as an additional structure
over EFs.

This section ends with the statement of the \Cref{thm:main}, which is a more abstract
variant of the \Cref{thm:FT}: in this version, the realizability structure realizing $\FT$ can have realizers of any form ($\lambda$-terms, Turing machines\ldots) as long as it gives an implementation of integers with its recursor, satisfies the two conditions mentioned above for the argument to work,
plus two additional technical conditions.
