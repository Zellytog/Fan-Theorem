\section{Introduction}

\input{introduction.tex}

\section{The realizability model}

We give a detailed construction of the realizability model: the logic used, the lambda-calculus and the realizability relation. We also give the standard theorem for a realizability model, namely the adequacy, which guaranties that we construct a consistant theory.

\input{realizability_relation.tex}

\input{adequacy.tex}

\section{The main result}

As the model is constructed, we can show the separation result between Fan Theorem and Weak König's Lemma. Before this, we give a list of $\lambda$-terms which implement important functions for our work. We then prove that $\FT$ holds, and that $\WKL$ fails.
